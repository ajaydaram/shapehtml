    <h3 class="remarks-heading">Remarks:</h3>
    <p class="remarks-paragraph">.1 Healing, Interpretation, Miracles and Tongues are not included in the assessment because their presence in the life ofa believer would be obvious and self-evident.</p>
        <p> 2. Healing, Interpretation, Miracles and Tongues tend to divide the Body of Christ when the issues are not adequately addressed from a balanced perspective. For the sake of harmony, they are thus excluded in this assessment questionnaire. They are best understood with further studies.</p>
